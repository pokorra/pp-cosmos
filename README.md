# Cosmos 

Hello, here you can see a landing page. Tiles on the left are supposed to fetch data from SpaceX API, so you can read about cosmic capsules, rockets etc.
On the right side you can launch rocket by your own - just by clicking on the button.

This website was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To run this project in the development mode, install npm in this folder, then type "npm start" and finally - open localhost:3000 in the browser.

You can also watch this project on github pages: [click](https://pokorra.github.io/pp-cosmos/)
